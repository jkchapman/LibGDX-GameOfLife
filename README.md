LibGDX-GameOfLife
=================

A desktop / html5 implementation of Conway's Game of Life, using the LibGDX framework.

##Building

LibGDX uses Gradle, so familiality with the system will be required to build all te project files in your chosen IDE.

This is easy in eclipse using the gradle plugin, found [here](https://www.gradle.org/tooling).

Once installed simply go to import a project, point to the root of the game folder, click "build model", and proceed to import and let Gradle work its magic!

##Compiling

Compiling for desktop is straight forward, requires jdk 7.

For HTML5, ensure you have Google's GWT plugin for eclipse, which you can find [here](https://developers.google.com/eclipse/).
